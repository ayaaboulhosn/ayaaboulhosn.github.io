Welcome! I am a 6th year PhD Candidate of Economics at American University, Washington DC. I am an applied microeconomist working on topics related to health, migration, gender and AI.
I am currently a [J-PAL MENA Fellow](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/updates/advancing-impact-j-pal-mena-welcomes-second-cohort-mena-scholars-fellowship-program) and a consultant with the [World Bank’s Development Economics Vice Presidency (DEC)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/unit-dec), working on the 2026 World Development Report—Artificial Intelligence for Development.

Before the PhD, I conducted fieldwork in Sierra Leone and with the World Bank in Lebanon. I received my Bachelors in Economics from UCLA.
