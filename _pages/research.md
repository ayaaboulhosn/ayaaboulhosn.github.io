## Working Papers
**<ins>Forced Migration and Natives’ Fertility</ins>** with Cevat Giray Aksoy and Berkay Ozcan

  **Abstract:** <br>
<div align="justify">
  The discussion on whether immigration solves the problems of population aging often focus on the fertility of immigrants. Additionally, standard projections consider the impact of migration on population growth but assume that the natives’ fertility does not change in response to migration. By contrast, we show that the native fertility is affected by immigration. In particular, we leverage the Syrian refugee migration to specific Turkish provinces shortly after the 2011 civil war as a source of variation in exposure to immigration. Employing two complementary instrumental variable strategies, we provide evidence that the fertility of natives increases in response to mass migration. These findings are robust across two distinct datasets, and we also observe a corresponding rise in subjective measures of fertility (that is, the ideal number of  children). Furthermore, we conduct additional analyses to examine four potential mechanisms and to highlight heterogeneity in fertility responses among different population subgroups. Our results suggest that factors related to the labor market and norm transmission can plausibly explain the observed increase in native fertility.

**<ins>Refugees and Access to Maternal Health Care Resources: Evidence from Turkey</ins>**

  **Abstract:** <br>
<div align="justify">
  The present study is the first to estimate the causal impact of an exogenous migration shock—Syrian refugee inflows into Turkey—on native women’s access to reproductive health care services. Using a distance-based instrument, I find that Turkish women exposed to a higher concentration of migrants experience higher rates of reproductive healthcare access, as compared to women who are not exposed to the migrant shock. I estimate that pre-maternal and post-maternal care usage among native women rises by 1.87 and 3.2 percentage points, respectively, due to an increase in the presence of Syrian migrants. The effects are largely driven by provinces that are developed in Turkey, with above-the-median GDP levels, whereas the effects disappear for provinces that are less developed. The main mechanism through which access to reproductive health services improves for natives is the increased government investment in the public health care system, but only for provinces with high GDP levels. This has important implications for both the ideal allocation of migrants across Turkey, and how policymakers can optimize the distribution of resources to compensate for the increased demand on the healthcare system.
