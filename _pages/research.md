*“Impact of Political Risk on Emerging Market Risk Premiums and Risk Adjusted Returns” with Ralph Sonenshine*
Research in International Business and Finance, 2025

  **Abstract:** <br>
  <div align="justify">
  Researchers have observed the political risk, sign paradox whereby a decrease in political risk is associated with an increase in stock market returns. However, the political risk-return relationship may be driven by a few political risk factors or emerging market countries. This paper examines this issue by assessing how key political risk components impact the equity risk premiums among emerging market (EM) countries. Using monthly stock market return data for 28 EM countries from 2000-2019, we segment countries into high and low political risk groups to explore heterogeneous effects. The findings are that democracy has a negative impact on equity premiums and risk adjusted returns, while law and order and investment profile have a positive impact on risk adjusted returns for low political risk countries. In addition, improvements in external conflict and government stability indicators result in larger risk adjusted returns, with the high political risk countries driving this effect.

## Working Papers
*“Forced Migration and Natives’ Fertility” with Cevat Giray Aksoy and Berkay Ozcan*

  **Abstract:** <br>
  <div align="justify">
  The discussion on whether immigration solves the problems of population aging often focus on the fertility of immigrants. Additionally, standard projections consider the impact of migration on population growth but assume that the natives’ fertility does not change in response to migration. By contrast, we show that the native fertility is affected by immigration. In particular, we leverage the Syrian refugee migration to specific Turkish provinces shortly after the 2011 civil war as a source of variation in exposure to immigration. Employing two complementary instrumental variable strategies, we provide evidence that the fertility of natives increases in response to mass migration. These findings are robust across two distinct datasets, and we also observe a corresponding rise in subjective measures of fertility (that is, the ideal number of  children). Furthermore, we conduct additional analyses to examine four potential mechanisms and to highlight heterogeneity in fertility responses among different population subgroups. Our results suggest that factors related to the labor market and norm transmission can plausibly explain the observed increase in native fertility.

*“Refugees and Access to Maternal Health Care Resources: Evidence from Turkey”*

  **Abstract:** <br>
    <div align="justify">

  The present study is the first to estimate the causal impact of an exogenous migration shock—Syrian refugee inflows into Turkey—on native women’s access to reproductive health care services. Using a distance-based instrument, I find that Turkish women exposed to a higher concentration of migrants experience higher rates of reproductive healthcare access, as compared to women who are not exposed to the migrant shock. I estimate that pre-maternal and post-maternal care usage among native women rises by 1.87 and 3.2 percentage points, respectively, due to an increase in the presence of Syrian migrants. The effects are largely driven by provinces that are developed in Turkey, with above-the-median GDP levels, whereas the effects disappear for provinces that are less developed. The main mechanism through which access to reproductive health services improves for natives is the increased government investment in the public health care system, but only for provinces with high GDP levels. This has important implications for both the ideal allocation of migrants across Turkey, and how policymakers can optimize the distribution of resources to compensate for the increased demand on the healthcare system.

## Work in Progress
*“The Impact of Remittances on Household Consumption: Evidence from Jordan”*
  
  **Abstract:** <br>
    <div align="justify">

  This paper assesses the persistent effects of remittances on household expenditure patterns in Jordan from 2006-2013 for twelve categories: food and non-alcoholic beverages, alcohol and tobacco, clothing and footwear, housing and utilities, furniture and housing equipment, health, communication, recreation and culture, education, restaurants and hotels, and miscellaneous goods. To address the endogeneity concerns of remittances, I use an instrumental variable approach that measures historical district-migration networks. I rely on the Jordanian Household Expenditure and Income Survey for annual expenditure data, household characteristics, and remittances, as well as the Jordanian Demographic and Health Survey of 1990 to calculate historical migration rates. I find that an increase in remittances results in an increase in food, housing and utilities, housing furniture, and education expenditure while the consumption of alcohol and tobacco decreases. These findings suggest that households in Jordan use remittances for human capital investment rather than conspicuous consumption that, in the long run, can promote higher levels of human capital and economic development.

*“Declining Terms of Trade after Experiencing Trade Marginalization: Global Evidence from 1982 to 2020” with Bernhard Gunter and Eduardo Lederman Rawet*
  
  **Abstract:** <br>
    <div align="justify">

  After decades of controversial debates on the validity of the so-called Prebisch-Singer Hypothesis, it is time to examine what other structural factors might contribute to a deterioration in the terms of trade. Building on recent research examining trade globalization and trade marginalization, this study shows that a country’s terms of trade deteriorate after a country experiences a period of significant trade marginalization, i.e., a significant decrease in a country’s export-to-GDP ratio. Though further research is needed, the emerging picture is that periods of trade marginalization cause structural changes that are then responsible for the declining terms of trade.
