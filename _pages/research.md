## Working Papers
**<ins>Forced Migration and Natives’ Fertility</ins>** with Cevat Giray Aksoy and Berkay Ozcan

  **Abstract:** <br>
<div align="justify">
  The discussion on whether immigration solves the problems of population aging often focus on the fertility of immigrants. Additionally, standard projections consider the impact of migration on population growth but assume that the natives’ fertility does not change in response to migration. By contrast, we show that the native fertility is affected by immigration. In particular, we leverage the Syrian refugee migration to specific Turkish provinces shortly after the 2011 civil war as a source of variation in exposure to immigration. Employing two complementary instrumental variable strategies, we provide evidence that the fertility of natives increases in response to mass migration. These findings are robust across two distinct datasets, and we also observe a corresponding rise in subjective measures of fertility (that is, the ideal number of  children). Furthermore, we conduct additional analyses to examine four potential mechanisms and to highlight heterogeneity in fertility responses among different population subgroups. Our results suggest that factors related to the labor market and norm transmission can plausibly explain the observed increase in native fertility.

**<ins>Refugees and Access to Maternal Health Care Resources: Evidence from Turkey</ins>**

  **Abstract:** <br>
<div align="justify">
  To what extent do mass supply and demand shocks to the healthcare system affect access to services? Are wealthier regions better equipped to withstand these shocks? Mass migration is considered a major shock to public health goods provision—increased demand may overwhelm the availability of goods and services, and affect natives’ access to resources. To understand how host governments and natives respond, I leverage the Syrian refugee influx into Turkey after the 2011 civil war to estimate the causal impact of migration on native women’s access to reproductive healthcare services. Using a distance-based instrument, I find Turkish women exposed to more migrants experience higher rates of prenatal and postnatal care usage, compared to women less exposed to migrants. The main mechanism is plausibly a shift to private healthcare usage, likely due to crowding out in public healthcare spaces. Native women in top wealth quintiles and developed provinces in Turkey drive the uptick in private healthcare usage, whereas the effects disappear for less developed provinces. On the supply side, I observe a shift in the quantity of healthcare professionals and hospital beds per capita from public to private spaces—but only in developed provinces. Important implications arise related to the ideal allocation of migrants across Turkey, how policymakers can optimize the distribution of public healthcare resources to compensate for the increased demand, and the crucial role the private sector can play in alleviating the burden on the public healthcare system.
